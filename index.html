                        After moving to the great country of the U.S. of A, adaptation to the unnecessarily large food portions. Mostly successful. Built my <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/7v8TMb">second PC</a>. Thanks to Mr. DeLeo and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-hollahan877/">Mr. Hollahan</a>, picked up on the whole bunch of conversational English that I was missing, with some writing tricks as well. Right now, enjoying my summertime while also trying to do something useful.

                        Period of great personal growth through friends and personal realisations and achievements.

                        <li>For the first time, found real friends and understood what a friend really is. Became much more outcoming and social as a result.</li>

                    <p>
                        Teamed up with one of my new friends to create my <strong>first project - a Discord server,</strong> that eventually got to more than 400 members.

                    <p>Got into computers in general, as well as coding. Did a lot of messing around in different programs that seemed cool and new to me, like FL Studio or Photoshop. Also got into gaming, with CS:GO being the first game I've played on Steam. Near the end of this period, already was a full-time tech support agent of the family.</p>
